## Activity 1: Creating a List of Data
| name              | rank | year | homeruns |
|-------------------|------|------|----------|
| Giancarlo Stanton | 1    | 2017 | 57       |
| Aaron Judge       | 2    | 2017 | 48       |
| J.D. Martinez     | 3    | 2017 | 43       |
| Khris Davis       | 4    | 2017 | 41       |

For this activity you will use d3 data binding to create a paragraph (`<p>`) for each player in the list. You will also add text content to each paragraph to describe the player's Home Runs for this season and their rank. In the end your web page should look like this:
